A few modifications are made to the [akanazawa/human_dynamics](https://github.com/akanazawa/human_dynamics) repository to extract HMMR from NTU videos. The `demo_videolist.py` script is launched as in `run.sh`. It iterates over a txt file of video names from the NTU dataset (skipping a few due to memory issues or no person found issues), it saves the bbox crop information as well as the hmmr_output. There are also minor edits in the `src/evaluation/run_video.py` as provided here, mainly not to spend time with extra visualizations and to clean up some img files after extraction. Please comply with the original license.
